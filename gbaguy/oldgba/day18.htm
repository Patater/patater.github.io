	Yes, BIOS. BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System, I don't know why they
called what the GBA has a BIOS, it doesn't do any real screen I/O. The GBA BIOS is more
like a small utility library with several useful functions that can be called.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>What the BIOS Has.</b></h2>

The BIOS has several functions that we are interested in, they are:

	Sqrt - Square Root Function, puts Square Root of r0 in r0.
	Div - Divide Function, divides r0 by r1 and puts the answer in r0.
		Also returns other things in r1 and r2, we'll get to those in Day 20.
	SoftReset - I suppose we could try doing this one tomorrow, maybe.

To call a BIOS function, you just fill certain CPU registers and then call the
function with an instruction that we'll discuss tomorrow.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>Where is the BIOS?</b></h2>

	The BIOS starts at 0x0000000 in memory and goes until 0x1000000 (I think).
The BIOS also contains several decompression routines and some kind of routines
to set rotation/scaling properties for both sprites and BGs.

	That's it for today, tomorrow we'll actually call a function.

	Until Then,
