<p>I'd like to give a special shout out to Trag. Without his caps, this project wouldn't have been possible. If you need caps for any of your recapping projects, my dealer can be your dealer: <a href="http://68kmla.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=4884">talk to the man</a>.

<p>I need to get some caps more from him. I am missing one capacitor in order to complete the replacement on my SE/30. I am also missing one capacitor in order to complete the replacement on my LC III. I was hoping to finish the SE/30 this weekend, but it looks like I'll have to wait until I can get my capacitor fix from trag again.</p>

<p>I had two dead Portable batteries. I wanted to re-cell them, so I attempted opening one with a screwdriver, but that totally messed up and and bent the plastic. I have one remaining, but I don't know how to open it cleanly in order to install new cells. I'd appreciate any advice you could give on rebuilding the Portable's battery.</p>

<p>I acquired a flaky Portable in 2003. It would often crash or sad mac, but it could boot and do stuff more often than not. When I tried to play with it again around February of 2010, I found that my PowerBook 100 adapter had failed (by no longer outputting any current; i.e. as soon as a load is present, the voltage goes to zero). I replaced all the capacitors and hooked up an alternate battery, but currently <a href="/dual-floppy-mac-portable-5">all I can get out of it is a sad mac</a>.

<p>My goal for this Portable is to get it running solid with a good battery and a good power adapter so that I can do software development on it. I am reading <em>Inside Macintosh</em> now to prepare for this. Eventually, I'd like to boost its RAM to the max, and that will probably involve creating new hardware. For now, unfortunately, this Portable is shelved.</p>
