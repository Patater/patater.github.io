description: Have you ever seen a dual floppy Macintosh Portable? I haven't. Let's make one.

<p>As this Conner hard drive I have seems very noisy and about to die, I'd like to try building a dual floppy Macintosh Portable. I have never owned a dual floppy Macintosh, but I think it would be very nice. I love the sounds that the Sony floppy drives make. To have two of them going at the same time would be aurally delicious, aside from being useful.</p>

<p>I have two Macintosh Portable floppy drives with lower deck brackets. I don't know what the upper deck floppy bracket looks like. I can mount the floppy drive I have into the upper deck hard drive bracket, but it leaves the top of the floppy drive unshielded and exposed. I also need very long floppy drive mounting screws, as the floppy drive is a little less wide than the hard drive.</p>

<p>Even after I do get the mounting issues solved, there will be the problem of being able to insert floppy disks into the drive. The removable plastic face plates I have are from hard drive Macintosh Portables, so they don't have a slot for floppy disk insertion. It has been recommended that I use a steel template and a rotary Dremel in order to add a slot to one of my face plates, but I don't have a model to base my cut on. Where I do the cut might stray from the model, depending on where the floppy drive ends up after my upper deck mounting job.</p>

<p>So, in summary, I humbly request assistance from the my readers in procuring pictures of the original dual floppy Macintosh Portable face plate and the upper deck floppy drive bracket. <a href="/contact">Any help or advice is much appreciated.</a></p>
