<p>Here is my latest restoration, my first one in a while. It turned out to be a pretty easy one. The computer was missing a hard drive and only had on-board memory. I couldn't find my floppy disk stash, so I recovered the computer without any floppy disks; I was very happy to have an AppleCD 600e drive to help out. The LC III now has 36 MB RAM and a 40MB SCSI HD with System 7.5.3. Don't you wish modern computers had as much RAM as hard disk space? Well, maybe you don't care about modern computers at all.</p>

<p>I'd like to put a IIe card into the LC III, but I haven't found any for sale that come with the cable.<p>

<p>My next project is restoring a SimasiMac SE/30. I haven't opened the case yet, but the machine looks to be in pretty bad shape. It will be quite an adventure.</p>
