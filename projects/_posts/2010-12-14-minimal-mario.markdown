<p>Inspired by the work of Calen Henry, I set out to do my first NES ROM hack:
a playable version of Minimal Mario. The end result is awesome, and
playable.</p>
<!--break-->

<h2>How to Get the Game</h2>
<img src="/images/minimal-mario-landscape.png"/>
<p>First, you need to make a dump of your Super Mario Bros. cart. The cart I
had ended up being detected as "Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!]", in <a
href="http://goodrom.free.fr/">the GoodROM database</a>.  You'll need to make
yourself a dump of this same cart. I recommend using <a
href="http://kevtris.org/Projects/copynes/buyit.html">CopyNES</a> from Kevin
Horton. Unfortunately, he's stopping making them for others. <a
href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&products_id=36">You can
buy a newer USB version of the CopyNES from Retrozone.</a> Refer to the <a
href="http://kevtris.org/Projects/copynes/copyware.html">CopyNES software
documentation</a> on how to make a clean dump of the game.</p> <p>The next step
is to apply <a href="/projects/minimal-mario.ips">my
IPS patch</a> to your freshly dumped game. To do this, you'll need an IPS
patcher; <a href="http://www.zophar.net/utilities/patchutil.html">pick your
favorite one.</a> (Hint: For Windows XP, I like Lunar IPS. For Mac OS X, I like
UIPS. For Linux, I like to use whatever the default package manager provides.)
Apply the patch and you are ready to play.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<img src="/images/minimal-mario-press-start.png"/>
<p>When you first start the game, you'll see this screen. To start a single
player game, press start. To start a two player game, press select, then start.
This is exactly the same as the normal Super Mario Bros. game.</p>

<h2>Watch a Playthrough</h2>

<p>A fellow named Billy, who found that the springboard wasn't very minimal in
my original patch, has uploaded a video of a play-through to YouTube. Be sure
to watch it in all its glory in super low resolution 240p!</p>
