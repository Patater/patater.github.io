<h2>About</h2>
<p>RGBCompare is a nifty little application for X86 Linux, Macintosh OS X, and
Windows. It allows you to compare how colors look on your PC and the Nintendo
DS (or any other 555-color based system).<!--break--> It was designed as an aid
to help graphics programmers correctly match colors or chose colors that were
consistent in both 555-color (RGB15) and 24-bit color (RGB24).</p>
