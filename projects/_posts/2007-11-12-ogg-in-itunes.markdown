<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The following guide will help you to play Ogg Vorbis files from iTunes.
This guide will work for both Macintosh OS X or Windows.

<h2>Extending QuickTime</h2>
<p>
First, you must download an Ogg vorbis plugin for quicktime. iTunes has
support for QuickTime formats, so adding the ability to QuickTime to
play Ogg files indirectly also allows iTunes to play them. You can get
<a href="http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/download.html">a good plugin for
Ogg from the Xiph project</a>.
</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>
After downloading and installing the codecs, you may need to restart
your computer. Next, we just add some Ogg files to iTunes and try it
out. One thing you'll notice is that metadata for the Ogg file is not
imported. This behavior is similar to how wav files work in iTunes. It
is a product of how iTunes deals with some QuickTime formats. You can
read more about this issue in this <a

ticket</a>.
