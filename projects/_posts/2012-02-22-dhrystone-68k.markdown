<p>Some guy named Landon Rodgers asked me to build the Dhrystone benchmarker for 68k Macintosh, so I did. I built it with THINK C 5, using 4-byte ints (instead of the default 2-byte ones), and without global optimizations. I had to modify the source a little bit to get it to build and run properly. (The source code and project file is included in the download.)</p>

<p>When the application starts, it will ask you to enter a number of runs. You should select a fairly large value here. The faster the computer you have, the larger this value should be. The more accurate measurement you want, the larger this value should be. On a Macintosh Plus, it doesn't take too long to get through 20000 runs. On a faster computer, that same number of runs would happen too quickly relative to the resolution of the system clock, so a larger value should be used. The application will tell you when you have selected too small of a value.</p>

<p>After the runs have been completed, you'll either be asked to enter a larger number of runs or you'll be presented with the benchmark results.</p>

<p>I hope you find this program to be fun, if not somewhat useful.</p>

<p>The source code license of Dhrystone 68k is the same as Dhrystone C 2.1, which I was told is in the public domain.</p>
