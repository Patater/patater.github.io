<p>1st Prize: Skate by Jimmy Phan</p>
<p>2nd Prize: Hunter or Hunted by Anthony Randazzo</p>
<p>3rd Prize: Happy Thanksgiving by Ryan FB</p>
<p>Wilcard: devkitPro by WinterMute</p>

<h2>Skate</h2>
<p>A clone of skate from WarioWare, Inc. but with a turkey skater.
Very hard game, especially when some of the blocks come at you from the
top and bottom at the same time and you can't dodge them and then
there's the invisible blocks; those are tough to dodge. I couldn't get
a score of 128 after 3 hours of play, so I guess that makes a ton of
turkey dinners. Very cute turkey sprite.</p>

<h2>Hunter or Hunted</h2>
<p>Looks promising. Needs a bit more time to get the bugs out. Had
trouble getting it to run on my gbamp.  Worked on my sc lite sd. Very
slow. The big map is too big. Very good use of the theme though. I
could beat the game as a turkey, but not as the hunter. I spent around
half an hour looking for some 99 turkeys in the big map, but could only
find one. The small map didn't work for me at all.</p>

<h2>Happy Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>This was our only tech demo entry. It demonstrates the use of the
console supplied by libnds by printing "Happy Thanksgiving!". How
exciting! Happy Thanksgiving to you too.</p>
