description: John Horton Conway devised this game in 1970. He played with it using chalkboards, checkers, or poker chips. Little did he know that we'd now be playing with it on our GPUs inside of hypertext browsers.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I am very interested in simple systems that exhibit complexity, and Conway's
Game of Life has some very simple rules. If a living cell has two or three
neighbors, it keeps on living. If a dead cell has three neighbors, it becomes
alive. The rules are that simple, yet its world is capable of great
complexity.</p>

<p>The GPU is a wonderful resource for performing parallel tasks, and Life is
very parallel. Every cell is changed at once in parallel based on how many
neighboring cells it has. I set out to use the GPU to implement the Game of
Life</p>

<p>I first implemented it using OpenCL on Mac OS X. I thought OpenCL would be
cross platform enough. However, I was disappointed by the runtimes available on
Windows and Linux. The skeleton code required for each platform was different.
Some runtimes only ran code on the CPU and not the GPU, and some not on their
creator's competitor's GPUs. I got fed up with the mess and decided not to
publish anything.</p>

<p>Then, a few weeks ago, I heard about WebCL. It sounded nice, but it
unfortunately isn't very well supported in browsers, currently. It requires
plugins from Nokia or Samsung. Nokia's plugin only works with Firefox and
Samsung's only works with Safari. Again, I was disappointed.</p>

<p>I had just seen <a
href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/arms-globe/?f=webgl">a cool,
interactive infographic that displays global small arms imports and exports</a>
when I thought that I could do Life in WebGL. I did some learning and found
WebGL to be very well suited for what I wanted to make: it provides access to
the GPU in a platform agnostic way.</a>

<p>I grabbed <a href="http://ricardocabello.com/blog/post/714">a WebGL example
from mr.doob</a>.  Thank you, mr.doob. His example contained a bit of
boilerplate to get me started. I then set out to write my first GLSL compute 
shader.</p>


<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>Here's how it works. <a
href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/webgl/glsl/04/">mr.doob's example</a> is
of a single texture on a single quad. We would like to do some computation
before rendering, though. We create two textures for use as frame buffers (so
we can render to them). We also need a new fragment shader to perform the
computation. This shader will alternatively read from one, previous state, texture (to count
neighbors of all the cells) and write to the other, current state, texture; the game world is
double buffered. Our rendering fragment shader will take whatever texture is
ready and sample it in order to generate pretty pictures.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>How you play is up to you. I've given you the game world and a 2x2 mouse
cursor.  You can draw stuff in the box. That is all. Enjoy!</p>

<p>I've also given you the source code, so you can hack around with it and make
something interesting. Use it for whatever you want, but be nice.</p>
