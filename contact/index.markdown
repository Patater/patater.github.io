There are a few ways to contact me, but by far the best way is by email.

<a href="mailto:jaeden@patater.com">Email me at jaeden@patater.com</a>. I
occasionally use AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), where I am CaptPatater. You may
also be able to catch me on <a href="/irc">Blitzed IRC at irc.blitzed.org
\#dsdev</a>, where I am Patater.

To contact Mike Huber, a.k.a. GBAGuy, <a
href="mailto:vbnetprogramer@hotmail.com">use vbnetprogramer@hotmail.com</a>.
