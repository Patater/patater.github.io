Ken Schwaber referenced this book in <a
href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7230144396191025011">his talk on
Scrum</a>. I found the book to be very interesting in parts, and a bit boring
and pedantic in others. The framework of thinking called the "knowledge spiral"
is fundmental to the book, but it is introduced in a boring part of the book.
The fun stuff are the case studies, interpreted through the knowledge spiral
framework, of the development  of innovative products.
