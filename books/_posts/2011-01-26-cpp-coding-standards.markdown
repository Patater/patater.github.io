I bought this book because I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/">Herb
Sutter's Guru of the Week</a>. It doesn't really provide any new information
that isn't on that web site, but it does put it into a book form that can be
more handy, loaned to others, or used as a quick reference on C++ idioms. A
rationale is provided for each rule. I'd recommend checking this book out from
your library to see if it is something you want to have in book form.
