This is a rocking cool book written by a fellow Nintendo DS homebrewer. I
really love the sci-fi setting of the book and recommend giving this book a
read to any fan of sci-fi, robots, experimental propulsion technologies, black
holes, AI, extraterrestrial life, and artificial satellites. I recommend this
book especially to those who are fans of all of those aforementioned things.
