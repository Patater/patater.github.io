It is amazing that all these great ideas could be contained in the mind of one
author. Many topics are covered, from formal systems and Gödel's Theorem to
computer languages, the Church-Turing Thesis, AI, and strange loops. The book
is an excellent, fun, tour through pretty much everything I personally find
interesting. The book is complete education all in itself.
