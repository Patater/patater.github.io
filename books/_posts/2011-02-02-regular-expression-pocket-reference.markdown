This is a super useful pocket reference. It contains a handful of expressive
examples written in each of Perl, Ruby, PHP, Python, C (using PCRE), and Java.
Since all of these languages do regular expressions in a different way, this
book helps those of us who have to work in multiple languages and can't
remember the specific details all the time. I keep this book nearby.
