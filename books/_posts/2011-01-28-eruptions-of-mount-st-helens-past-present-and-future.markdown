I got this book in elementary school from the Mount St. Helens visitors'
center. I liked the mountain a lot. It was amazing to see something so perfect
and beautiful destroyed by its own power. This book documents the famous May
18, 1980 eruption and how it changed the landscape around Mount St. Helens with
wonderful photos and cool illustrations, and some text.
