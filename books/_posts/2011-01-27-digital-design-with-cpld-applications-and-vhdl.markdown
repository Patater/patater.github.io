This book introduced me to digital logic, digital electronics, and CPLD
programming with VHDL. It was the textbook used in DeVry's Summer Scholars
electronics introduction course. DeVry is a for profit school whose credits
didn't transfer to the university I ended up going to, but this book is
alright.
