This book is a wonderful introduction to machine learning. It was my textbook
for my undergrad course in machine learning at my school, and probably many
others. It is a great standard introduction, laying down the fundamentals and
then covering a wide array of topics in machine learning. After advances in
this field over the past years, I hope to see a new edition of this book.
