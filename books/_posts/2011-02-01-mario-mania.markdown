This was the most beat up magazine at my local library growing up. Hundreds of
kids must have poured over that copy. It isn't only the player's guide for the
best Super Mario game ever made, it also covers a lot of Mario history. I loved
reading it, looking at the wonderful hand-drawn illustrations, and playing the
game with my finger over the printed maps. It was only natural that I bought my
own copy years later.
