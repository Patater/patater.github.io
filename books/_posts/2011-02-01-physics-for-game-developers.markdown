I should have checked this one out from the library instead of buying it, but
O'Reilly had a good sale going on. I bought it just for the title. However, if
you already know your basic physics and are a decent programmer, you don't need
this book at all. On the plus side, it has many examples. But again on the
downside, the example code is very ugly (as seems to be common for game code).
