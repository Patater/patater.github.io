I bought this book for way too much money for my first class in college
physics, sans calculus. I kept onto this book for some reason, despite it being
so expensive and textbooky. It also doesn't make sense to study physics without
calculus. Without calculus, physics is just memorization of solutions to
differential equations, which isn't very enlightening.
