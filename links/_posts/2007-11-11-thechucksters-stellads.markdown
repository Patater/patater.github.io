TheChuckster returns with what might turn into an incredible project. This time
around, he brings us an Atari 2600 emulator, complete with a 6502 core written
in C++ ported from Stella (stella.sourceforge.net). He promises that this
project may spawn an Apple II emulator. We'll see what comes of that. If you
have any news regarding an Apple II emulator, please contact me.
