TheChuckster returns with what might turn into an incredible project. This time
around, he brings us an Atari 2600 emulator, complete with a 6502 core written
in C++ ported from <a href="http://stella.sourceforge.net/">Stella</a>. He
promises that this project may spawn an Apple II emulator. We'll see what comes
of that. If you have any news regarding an Apple II emulator, please <a
href="/contact">contact me</a>
