Ran by the same guy who runs gbadev. A nice place for homebrew news and forums
and such. But currently, there is more DS related activity on the gbadev forums
relating to DS development. Perhaps the web master will combine the two forums
eventually, so that you can participate in the gbadev forums relating to NDS on
the dsdev forums.
