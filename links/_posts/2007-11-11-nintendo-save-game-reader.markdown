Ever wanted to manage multiple saves for a game, see what it was like to get
all 150 stars in Super Mario 64 DS without actually earning them? This little
hardware device is the tool for you. Now you won't have to worry about your
little sibling erasing your save games ever again. This device is a Nintendo DS
save game reader. And if you know Japanese, you can build one too.
