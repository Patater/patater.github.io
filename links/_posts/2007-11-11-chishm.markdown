Awesome dude. The genius behind the GBA NDS FAT library. He's enabled the
community with a great universal filesystem. Cheers to Chishm and his continued
participation in the community. Because of his creation of the FAT library for
a variety of DS accessories, we are forever in his debt. He has made our dreams
come true.
