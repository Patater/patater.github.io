Mr.Spiv is a guy who saw the need for more Mac support in the GBA and NDS dev
communities and took it on himself to provide a few solutions. He compiles
devkitPro and libnds for Mac kiddies as well as making linker software. He is
currently working of some NeoFlash linker software for the Macintosh.
