Lynx maintains a database of Nintendo DS systems, their colors, and their
origins. Check to see if your Nintendo DS needs a special kind of PassMe to run
homebrew apps. Submit your Nintendo DS and help make the tracker a more useful
tool. This database also has a cool side effect&colon; you can see just how
many people are running homebrew, and the list is HUEG!
