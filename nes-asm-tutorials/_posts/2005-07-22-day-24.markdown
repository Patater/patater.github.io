<h2>Full Byte of Keys</h2>
<div class="warning">
<p>NOTE: I don't know if this code works or not. I have not had a chance to test it yet.</p>
</div>

<p>Someone emailed me with this question. If I understood the email correctly, this is what
he wanted to know.</p>

<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>This following code will assume you've already strobed/reset $4016:</p>
<code class="block">
; after code is done, key will be in A
;--CODE START--;
ReadKeyByte:
    ldx #8
loopKeybyte:
    ora $4016
    asl
    dex
    bne loopKeybyte
;--CODE END--;
</code>

<h3>This Day In Review</h3>

<p>My appologies to the person who emailed me about this, I had this file sitting around
for some time. This file (if I haven't figured out if the code works yet) is part of my new policy
of putting up things even if tests aren't done or are inconclusive.</p>
