<h2>The PPU</h2>
<p>To get anything at all to happen on the NES in terms of graphical output, we
need to program the PPU (Picture Processing Unit). To program the PPU, we store values
into certain memory addresses that when set will cause the NES to setup the PPU with
those values. All programming on the NES is done using what's called "Memory Mapped
Registers", you may know about this if you've programmed for the GBA. For you Intel
knowledgable people, this is totally foriegn.</p>

<h3>Binary Notation</h3>

<p>Just to be absolutely clear, we will give the bits of a memory register in the
following order:
<pre>
    Here's a random binary number (1 byte), and how we number it's bits:
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1

    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
</pre>
So the 7th bit is on the left and 0 bit on the right.
</p>

<h3>Setting Up The PPU</h3>

<p> Note that one of the first things we need to do is set-up the PPU. We do
this by storing values into $2000 and $2001 which are the 2 PPU control
registers in memory. Here's the excerpt from <a
href="http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/nestech100.txt">YOSHi's doc</a> to explain
$2000 and $2001:
<pre>
    0 = Always zero              1 = Always 1
    - = Not used                 ? = Unknown

</p>

<p>To set-up the PPU we do 2 stores into memory. The code is:</p>
<code class="block">
    lda #%00001000
    sta $2000
    lda #%00011110
    sta $2001
</code>


<p>The value we put into $2000 tells the PPU that the 2 NMIs are disabled,
sprite size is 8x8, we use Screen pattern table $0000 and sprite pattern table
$1000, increment addresses by 1, and we'll be using Name Table at $2000. These
2 memory registers are probably the two most complicated, but still easy, mem.
registers to use.</p>

<p>The store into $2001 tells the PPU to not influence the palette toward any certain color,
show sprites, turn the screen on, show sprites everywhere, show left 8 pixels, color display.</p>

<p>You should be able to figure all that out by looking at the binary number
and using the notation I already showed you to figure out what the bits mean
when we load registers.</p>

<h3>What Else Do We Do To Get Output?</h3>

<p>If you are talking about backgrounds, we need to do a couple of things:</p>
<ol><u>Making A Background:</u>
<li>Draw some tiles in Tile Layer Pro.</li>
<li>Include that file as the first file in bank 2.</li>
<li>Create and Load a palette.</li>
<li>Set tile numbers in Name Table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voil√†! The background appears!</p>


<p>For sprites, the steps are slightly different:</p>
<ol><u>Making A Sprite:</u>
<li>Draw the sprites in Tile Layer Pro.</li>
<li>Include that file as the second file in bank 2.</li>
<li>Create and Load a palette.</li>
<li>Set sprite attributes in Sprite data memory (like OAM on GBA).</li></ol>
<p>Ka boom! Sprite appears!</p>


<p>We'll learn how to load the palette tomorrow! Note that loading the palette
is important as half is the background palette and half is the sprite palette.</p>

<h3>This Day In Review</h3>

<p>Wow! We're really movin' along here, aren't we? As I said, tomorrow we load
the palette. Until then, good-night (I'm sleepy :) ).</p>

<p>
    Until Tomorrow,<br/>
