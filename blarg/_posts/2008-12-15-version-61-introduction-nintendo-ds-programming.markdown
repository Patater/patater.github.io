After a four day wait lag time, <a href="/manual">the manual is back</a> and
its source code is ready to compile with libnds 1.3.1. Thanks for waiting.
Enjoy!

This release is meant to simply get the code compiling again. I don't yet use
the new high level APIs that this version of libnds introduces. I'm saving that
work for the next version of the manual. I have a few new chapters in the works
that I'll be slipping in next time, as well.
