description: The world's best Nintendo DS links are back and they are the same as ever!

I used to run <a href="/links">the world's best Nintendo DS links page</a>.
Since that time, I've migrated my website from static pages, through a few
different custom content management systems. Some of these systems didn't
support links pages. My latest website architecture does, but my content is
still old, not having been updated since 2007.

To help recover the goodness that once was, and to protect future goodness, I
will write a cron job to check for broken links. Checking for squatted links
will be a more difficult problem, I think.

I hope you can <a href="/links">enjoy the links</a> still. They may provide a
nice nostalgic feeling. If you need to, you can use <a
href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">archive.org's WayBack Machine</a> to
view many of these pages that have left the modern internet.
